## Learn the Basics

### HTML: The Building Blocks of the Web

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a language used to create the structure and layout of web pages. It is the backbone of all websites, and it is used to create headings, paragraphs, links, images and other elements that make up a webpage. HTML uses tags, which are enclosed in angle brackets, to define the different types of elements on a webpage.

### CSS: The Style of the Web

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language used to add style and layout to web pages. It is used to change the font, color, spacing, and other visual elements of web pages. It allows you to separate the presentation of a webpage from its structure, making it easier to maintain and update the design of a website. CSS uses selectors, which identify the HTML elements to be styled, and declarations, which specify the styles to be applied.

## Coding: A Fun and Rewarding Career

Coding can be a fun and rewarding career. It allows you to use your creativity to build and create things that make a difference in the world. With practice and determination, anyone can learn to code and become a successful coder.
