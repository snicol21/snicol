After completing [Mosh Hamedani's Data Structures and Algorithms course](https://codewithmosh.com/p/data-structures-algorithms-part1), I found it to be an incredibly valuable resource. With a finance degree and a career that has taken some unexpected turns, I discovered a talent for software development and programming. However, I have sometimes felt at a disadvantage when unable to converse fluently with other developers. This course has helped me to think like a programmer.

## What is it?

Big O notation is a fundamental concept in computer science that describes how scalable an algorithm is or its runtime complexity. This notation provides a way for developers to evaluate and compare different algorithms, helping them choose the most efficient one for a given task. For those who are new to programming, learning Big O notation can be challenging, but it's a crucial skill that is often tested in interviews at big companies. Through the use of Big O notation, developers can "think like a programmer" and gain a deeper understanding of how to create efficient and scalable code.

> Big O notation is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity.

## Constant Time Complexity: O(1)

- The number of operations is constant.

```java
public static int add(int a, int b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

This is a simple function that adds two integers and returns the result.

Regardless of the values of a and b, this function performs a fixed number of operations (in this case, a single addition operation) and returns the result. This means that the time required to run this function is constant and does not change as the input values change.

## Linear Time Complexity: O(n)

- The number of operations it performs scales in direct proportion to the input.
- As the input grows, so do the number of operations, linearly. Our function needs to perform the same number of operations for every input.
- An example of this would be a "loop".

```java
public static int sum(int[] array) {
  int sum = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
    sum += array[i];
  }
  return sum;
}
```

This function takes an array of integers as input and returns the sum of all the elements in the array.

In each iteration of the for loop, the algorithm performs a single addition operation to update the sum variable with the value of the current element in the array. Since the loop iterates over each element in the array exactly once, the number of operations required is proportional to the size of the input array.

## Quadratic Time Complexity: O(n^2)

- The number of operations it performs scales in proportion to the square of the input.
- An example of this would be a "nested loop".

```java
public static int sumPairs(int[] array) {
  int sum = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < array.length; j++) {
      sum += array[i] + array[j];
    }
  }
  return sum;
}
```

In each iteration of the outer loop, the algorithm selects an element i from the array. In each iteration of the inner loop, the algorithm selects an element j from the array and adds the sum of the elements at indices i and j to the running total. Since the loops iterate over all possible pairs of elements in the array, the total number of operations required is proportional to the size of the input array squared.

## Logarithmic Time Complexity: O(log n)

- The number of operations grows very slowly as the input size grows.

```java
public static int binarySearch(int[] array, int target) {
  int low = 0;
  int high = array.length - 1;

  while (low <= high) {
    int mid = (low + high) / 2;
    if (array[mid] == target) {
      return mid;
    } else if (array[mid] < target) {
      low = mid + 1;
    } else {
      high = mid - 1;
    }
  }

  return -1;
}
```

This is an iterative binary search algorithm that searches for a target value in a sorted array.

In each iteration of the while loop, the algorithm divides the size of the search space in half by checking whether the target value is less than, greater than, or equal to the value at the midpoint of the current search space. This means that the search space is reduced by a factor of 2 in each iteration, leading to a logarithmic time complexity.

For example, if we call binarySearch with an array of size 8, it will take at most 3 iterations to find the target (since log base 2 of 8 is 3). Similarly, if we call binarySearch with an array of size 1,000,000, it will take at most 20 iterations to find the target (since log base 2 of 1,000,000 is approximately 20).

## Exponential Time Complexity: O(2^n)

- The number of operations grows at an increasing rate as the input size grows.

```java
public static int fibonacci(int n) {
  if (n <= 1) {
    return n;
  } else {
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2);
  }
}
```

This is a recursive method that calculates the nth Fibonacci number. It has an exponential time complexity of O(2^n), because each call to fibonacci results in two more calls, leading to an exponentially increasing number of function calls as n gets larger.

To see the exponential time complexity of this method in action, try running it with a large input value, like fibonacci(40). You'll notice that it takes a long time to compute the result, because the number of function calls grows exponentially with the input value.
