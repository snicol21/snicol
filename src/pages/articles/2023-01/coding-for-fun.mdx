## What is coding?

Coding is the process of creating instructions for a computer to execute. It's
like giving instructions to a robot to perform certain tasks.

**Java**

- Widely used for developing enterprise applications, mobile apps, and Android
  apps. (Google, Amazon, and Oracle)
- The popular and loving games, Minecraft and Angry Birds were coded in Java.
- Google Maps is coded in Java

```java
public class HelloWorld {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello World!");
  }
}
```

**Python**

- No, not the snake. üêç
- High-level programming language that is used for a wide range of purposes,
  including data analysis, machine learning, and web development. (Google,
  Facebook, and Netflix)

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

**C++**

- Powerful programming language that is used for developing system software,
  video games, and desktop applications. (Microsoft, Amazon, and Apple)

```c
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

**JavaScript**

- Popular programming language that is primarily used for creating interactive
  web pages and web applications. (Google, Facebook, and Amazon)

```javascript
console.log('Hello, World!');
```

**C# (C-Sharp)**

- General-purpose programming language that is used for developing Windows
  desktop and mobile apps. (Microsoft and Unity)

```csharp
using System;

class HelloWorld
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

**PowerShell**

- Command-line shell and scripting language that is used for automating tasks
  and managing systems. It can also be used for automating repetitive tasks,
  such as backups and software installations, and for automating the creation
  and management of virtual machines.

```powershell
Write-Host "Hello, World!"
```

**Bash**

- Bash (short for "Bourne-Again Shell") is a Unix shell and command-line
  interface. It is the default shell on most Linux and macOS systems, as well as
  on other Unix-based operating systems. Bash is used to execute commands and
  run scripts, and it provides a wide range of features for interacting with the
  operating system and other programs.

```bash
echo "Hello, World!"
```

### HTML: The Building Blocks of the Web

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a language used to create the structure and
layout of web pages. It is the backbone of all websites, and it is used to
create headings, paragraphs, links, images and other elements that make up a
webpage. HTML uses tags, which are enclosed in angle brackets, to define the
different types of elements on a webpage.

```html
<h1>Hello World!</h1>
<button id="myButton">Click me</button>
```

### CSS: The Style of the Web

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language used to add style and layout to web
pages. It is used to change the font, color, spacing, and other visual elements
of web pages. It allows you to separate the presentation of a webpage from its
structure, making it easier to maintain and update the design of a website. CSS
uses selectors, which identify the HTML elements to be styled, and declarations,
which specify the styles to be applied.

```css
h1 {
  color: blue;
}
```

### Javascript: The Interactivity of the Web

JavaScript is the programming language that makes web pages interactive and
dynamic. It is used to add behavior and logic to websites, such as creating
responsive forms, interactive maps, and dynamic content updates. It allows web
developers to create complex and dynamic user interfaces, and to make web pages
more responsive to user input and interaction.

```javascript
var button = document.getElementById('myButton');
button.addEventListener('click', function () {
  alert('Hello World!');
});
```
