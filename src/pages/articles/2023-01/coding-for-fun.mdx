## Code Examples in Popular Programming Languages

Here are some basic code examples to give you a better understanding of what
programming looks like in some of the most popular languages. Each code snippet
is accompanied by a brief explanation of the language and what the code does.
Feel free to experiment with these examples, modify them, and make them your
own.

### Java

Java is a versatile programming language that can be used for developing various
applications such as web and mobile apps, desktop software, and games. It is
also used extensively in enterprise-level systems. Some popular games and
software written in Java include Minecraft, OpenOffice, and Android Studio.

Generates a random jersey number between 1 and 99 for a soccer team using the
`java.util.Random` library:

```java
import java.util.Random;

public class SoccerJersey {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Random rand = new Random();
        int jerseyNum = rand.nextInt(99) + 1;
        System.out.println("Your jersey number is: " + jerseyNum);
    }
}
```

### Python

Python is a popular programming language known for its simplicity and ease of
use. It can be used for developing various applications such as web
applications, scientific computing, and machine learning. Some popular games and
tools written in Python include the game Civilization IV, YouTube, and Dropbox.

Calculates the average number of points scored per game for a basketball player
based on their total points and games played:

```python
total_points = 500
games_played = 20
avg_points = total_points / games_played

print("Average points per game: " + str(avg_points))
```

### C++

C++ is a powerful and versatile programming language that is widely used in game
development, operating systems, and high-performance applications. Some popular
games and software written in C++ include the game World of Warcraft, the
operating system Windows, and the Adobe Suite.

Determines if a hockey team has made the playoffs based on their number of wins,
losses, and overtime losses:

```c
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int wins = 30, losses = 20, ot_losses = 10;
    int points = (wins * 2) + ot_losses;
    bool made_playoffs = points >= 80;

    if (made_playoffs) {
        cout << "Congratulations, your team made the playoffs!" << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "Sorry, your team did not make the playoffs." << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### JavaScript

JavaScript is a popular programming language that is used extensively in web
development. It can be used for creating interactive web pages, developing
server-side applications, and building mobile apps. Some popular websites and
tools written in JavaScript include Google Maps, Gmail, and Facebook.

Calculates the distance a football quarterback can throw a ball based on their
arm strength and angle:

```javascript
let arm_strength = 70; // in yards
let angle = 45; // in degrees
let velocity = arm_strength * 0.447; // convert yards per second to meters per second
let distance = (velocity ** 2 * Math.sin((2 * angle * Math.PI) / 180)) / 9.8;

console.log('Maximum throwing distance: ' + distance.toFixed(2) + ' meters');
```

### HTML

HTML is the foundation of every website, providing the structure and content of
web pages. Here's an example of how HTML can be used to create a simple
basketball scoreboard.

This HTML code creates a basic basketball scoreboard with two teams, Team A and
Team B. Each team has a name and a score that starts at 0. The scoreboard is
contained within a `<div>` element with a class of "scoreboard". The teams are
represented by `<div>` elements with a class of "team", and each team has a
`<h2>` element for their name and two `<p>` elements for their name and score.

```html
<div class="scoreboard">
  <div class="team">
    <h2>Home</h2>
    <p class="name">Team A</p>
    <p class="score">0</p>
  </div>
  <div class="team">
    <h2>Away</h2>
    <p class="name">Team B</p>
    <p class="score">0</p>
  </div>
</div>
```

### CSS

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used for describing the
presentation of a document written in HTML. It defines how HTML elements should
be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.

This CSS snippet shows how to style a scoreboard element for a sports website.
The scoreboard element has a dark background with white text, and includes a
team name and score displayed in a large font. The scoreboard class can be
applied to any element on the page to create a scoreboard.

```css
/* A CSS snippet for displaying a scoreboard */
.scoreboard {
  background-color: #333;
  color: #fff;
  padding: 10px;
  text-align: center;
  font-size: 24px;
  border-radius: 5px;
  display: inline-block;
  margin: 10px;
}

.scoreboard span {
  display: block;
  margin-bottom: 5px;
}

.scoreboard .team-name {
  font-weight: bold;
}

.scoreboard .score {
  font-size: 48px;
  margin-bottom: 10px;
}
```

### C# (C-Sharp)

C# is a modern, object-oriented programming language that is used for developing
Windows desktop applications, web applications, and games. Some popular games
and software written in C# include the game Hearthstone, the Unity game engine,
and the financial software Quicken.

Calculates the average speed of a sprinter based on the distance they ran and
the time it took:

```csharp
using System;

class SprinterSpeed {
    static void Main() {
        int distance_meters = 100;
        int time_seconds = 10;
        double speed_mps = distance_meters / (double)time_seconds;
        double speed_kph = speed_mps * 3.6;

        Console.WriteLine("Average speed: " + speed_kph.ToString("0.00") + " km/h");
    }
}
```

### PowerShell

PowerShell is a task automation and configuration management framework developed
by Microsoft. It is used primarily in system administration, and can be used for
automating administrative tasks, creating custom tools, and managing Windows
systems.

Calculates the body mass index (BMI) for a football player based on their weight
and height:

```powershell
$weight_kg = 120
$height_cm = 180
$height_m = $height_cm / 100.0
$bmi = $weight_kg / ($height_m * $height_m)

Write-Host "Body mass index: $($bmi.ToString("0.00"))"
```

### Bash

Bash is a Unix shell and command language that is used in system administration
and automation. It can be used for creating shell scripts, managing file
systems, and automating repetitive tasks.

This script prompts the user to enter their name and then prints out a greeting.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "What's your name?"
read name
echo "Hello, $name!"
```

### Typescript

TypeScript is a strongly-typed, object-oriented programming language that is a
superset of JavaScript. It compiles to plain JavaScript, making it compatible
with all browsers, devices, and operating systems. TypeScript is used to develop
large-scale web applications, both on the client and server side. It is known
for its powerful type system, which helps catch errors at compile time, making
it easier to maintain large codebases. Some popular tools and frameworks that
use TypeScript include Angular, React, and Vue.js.

This program defines a class representing a basketball player with a name and a
score, and then creates an instance of that class and logs it to the console.

```typescript
class Player {
  name: string;
  score: number;
  constructor(name: string, score: number) {
    this.name = name;
    this.score = score;
  }
}

const lebron = new Player('LeBron James', 27);
console.log(lebron);
```

### YAML

YAML stands for "YAML Ain't Markup Language". It is a human-readable data
serialization format that is often used for configuration files and data
exchange between languages. YAML is used by many software applications,
including Kubernetes, Docker, and Ansible, as a way to specify and configure
their services. It is known for its simplicity, which makes it easy to read and
write, and its flexibility, which allows it to be easily integrated with other
programming languages.

This YAML file defines a list of basketball teams and their corresponding
win-loss records.

```yml
teams:
  - name: Los Angeles Lakers
    wins: 42
    losses: 30
  - name: Brooklyn Nets
    wins: 48
    losses: 24
  - name: Golden State Warriors
    wins: 39
    losses: 33
```
